## Deploy Web Application

When opening a new issue in the `Code-and-Response/Project-Sample` issue tracker, please provide as much
detail about your environment as possible.

See [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

Once an issue has been opened, it is not uncommon for there to be discussion
around it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue,
including whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion
is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Short, clipped responses—that provide neither additional context nor supporting
detail—are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are simply
annoying and unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much
as possible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you
choose to comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs
to be fixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is
incorrect, explain *why* you feel that way with additional supporting context,
and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often
reach the correct outcome much faster.

In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request.
The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request isa similar to that of
opening and triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval
workflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality and
functional guidelines.
